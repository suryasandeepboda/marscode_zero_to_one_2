Initial Prompt:

Problem Statement:I have a Google Sheet named “Marscode V2 responses”. Would like to extract specific columns like Context Awareness, Autonomy, Experience, Output Quality along with the ratings.
Requirements/Goals:
Access the Google Sheet “https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15FMeidgU2Dg7Q4JKPkLAdJmQ3IxWCWJXjhCo9UterCE/edit?gid=2052232470#gid=2052232470” using Google APIs with the Credentials.json
Extract specific columns like  Context Awareness, Autonomy, Experience, Output Quality along with the ratings.
Calculate the Mean Rating for all these metrics and introduce a new column in the output sheet named “Mean Rating”
Find the difference between Mean Rating and Overall Satisfaction column.
Introduce a new column called “Result” and mark this column “Ok” and color the cell green if the difference is in between -1 to 1.
Mark the “Result” column “Not ok” and color the cell “Red” if the difference is less than -1 and greater than +1.
The output columns should be “Email address”, “Tool used”, “Feature Used”, “Context Awareness”, “Autonomy”, “Experience”, “Output Quality”.”Overall Rating”, “Mean Rating”, “Difference”, “Result”, “Unique ID”, “Pod” and should be created in a Target Google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FEqiDqqPfb9YHAWBiqVepmmXj22zNqXNNI7NLGCDVak/edit?gid=0#gid=0

Context/Tools:
Check that the Source Google sheet and Target Google sheet is shared with the Google Service Account for Read and Write access.
All the Python Google API dependencies are installed in the project
Task:
 Please generate a concise, step-by-step plan or outline for addressing the above problem. The outline should include:
Overall Approach:
Summarize how you will structure the solution from start to finish.
Data/Resource Access:
Explain any required setup or authentication (if applicable).
Solution Steps:
List each major step to implement (e.g., retrieving data, processing/calculating values, handling edge cases, etc.).
Testing & Validation Strategy:
Briefly describe how you would test or verify each part of the solution.
Potential Edge Cases & Error Handling:
Indicate any likely pitfalls and how you’d handle them.
Format your response as a bullet-point or numbered outline. Avoid writing any actual code at this stage—focus on the plan itself.


Reponse: 
I'll help you create a structured plan to solve this Google Sheets data processing task. Here's the detailed outline:

### Overall Approach
- Create a Python script that uses Google Sheets API
- Read data from source sheet, process it, and write to target sheet
- Implement color formatting and conditional logic for results

### Data/Resource Access Setup
1. Authentication Requirements:
   - Use credentials.json for service account authentication
   - Verify access permissions for both sheets:
     - Source: "Marscode V2 responses"
     - Target: Output sheet
   - Initialize Google Sheets API client

### Solution Steps
1. Data Retrieval
   - Connect to source spreadsheet
   - Extract required columns:
     - Email address
     - Tool used
     - Feature Used
     - Context Awareness
     - Autonomy
     - Experience
     - Output Quality
     - Overall Rating
     - Unique ID
     - Pod

2. Data Processing
   - Calculate Mean Rating:
     - Average of (Context Awareness, Autonomy, Experience, Output Quality)
   - Calculate difference:
     - Difference = Mean Rating - Overall Rating
   - Determine Result status:
     - "Ok" (green) if -1 ≤ difference ≤ 1
     - "Not ok" (red) if difference < -1 or > 1

3. Output Generation
   - Create formatted output data structure
   - Write to target spreadsheet
   - Apply conditional formatting for Result column

### Testing & Validation Strategy
1. Input Validation
   - Verify all required columns exist in source sheet
   - Check for missing or invalid data
   - Validate numeric ratings are in expected range

2. Calculation Verification
   - Test Mean Rating calculation
   - Verify difference calculation
   - Confirm Result column logic

3. Output Validation
   - Verify all rows are processed
   - Check formatting is applied correctly
   - Validate data integrity in target sheet

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
1. Potential Issues
   - Missing or null values in rating columns
   - Non-numeric ratings
   - API rate limits
   - Permission issues
   - Network connectivity problems

2. Error Handling Approach
   - Implement try-catch blocks for API operations
   - Log errors and exceptions
   - Skip invalid rows with warnings
   - Implement retry mechanism for API calls

3. Data Quality Checks
   - Validate rating ranges (typically 1-5)
   - Handle empty cells
   - Process partial data if some columns are missing

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific part of this plan?
